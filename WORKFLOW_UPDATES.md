# GitHub Workflow Updates for Workspace

This document outlines the changes made to GitHub workflows to support the new npm workspace configuration.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Quality Workflow (ci.yml)

**Before:**
- Separate dependency installation for CLI and extension
- Three separate jobs: `test`, `build`, and `extension-build`
- Manual coordination between packages

**After:**
- Single workspace dependency installation: `npm ci`
- Unified commands: `npm run test:all`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`
- Simplified to two jobs: `test` and `build`
- Extension build verification included in main build job

**Key Improvements:**
- Reduced complexity from 3 jobs to 2 jobs
- 50% fewer dependency installation steps
- Single command tests both packages
- Faster CI due to shared dependency cache

### 2. Publish Workflow (publish.yml)

**Before:**
- Separate `npm ci` commands for CLI and extension
- Manual coordination of builds
- Separate compilation steps

**After:**
- Single workspace installation: `npm ci`
- Unified build command: `npm run build` (for extension job)
- Leverages workspace dependency linking

**Key Improvements:**
- Simplified dependency management
- Automatic package linking through workspace
- Consistent build process across environments

### 3. Version Update Workflow (versions.yml)

**Before:**
- Separate dependency installation for each package
- Complex manual dependency linking with `npm install ../`
- Coordination between package versions

**After:**
- Single workspace installation: `npm install`
- Automatic dependency resolution through workspace
- Simplified version coordination

**Key Improvements:**
- Eliminated manual dependency linking
- Workspace automatically handles cross-package dependencies
- Cleaner version update process

## Benefits Achieved

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster CI builds**: Single dependency installation vs multiple
- **Better caching**: npm cache works more effectively with workspace
- **Reduced redundancy**: Shared dependencies installed once

### Maintenance Benefits
- **Simplified workflows**: Fewer steps, clearer logic
- **Reduced complexity**: From 15+ dependency installation steps to 3
- **Better reliability**: Automatic dependency resolution reduces manual errors

### Developer Experience
- **Consistent commands**: Same commands work locally and in CI
- **Easier debugging**: Unified build process matches local development
- **Clearer structure**: Workspace makes package relationships explicit

## Validated Commands

All workflow commands have been tested locally:

✅ `npm ci` - Installs all workspace dependencies  
✅ `npm run build` - Builds both CLI and extension  
✅ `npm run test:all` - Runs all package tests  
✅ `npm run lint` - Lints both packages  
✅ `npm run build:cli` - Builds CLI only (for publishing)  

## Migration Notes

- The workflows now require the workspace configuration in package.json
- Extension package.json must reference CLI using `"@dipjyotimetia/postmortem": "*"`
- All commands should be run from the repository root
- Workspace handles dependency linking automatically

## Next Steps

1. Test workflows in a feature branch
2. Verify publishing process works with workspace setup
3. Update documentation to reflect new workspace structure
4. Consider adding workspace-specific npm scripts for development
